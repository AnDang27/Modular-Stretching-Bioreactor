## Problem Statement

A modular stretching bioreactor is a device used in laboratories to study the effect of mechanical load on cells throughout the mechanotransduction pathway. These devices apply compressive or tensile mechanical forces on chambers seeded with various cell types. Current cell stretching devices on the market have adequate mechanical capabilities (i.e. maximal strain and strain rate). However, these devices cannot control temperature, carbon dioxide, and humidity content, which are key components in a typical cell incubator. Thus, they are not suitable for long-term (4+ hours) cell culture experiments as the current model is placed in a benchtop incubator. In addition, the current device used by the customer has no automated programming (i.e. start/stop, strain rate, and maximal strain) and can only perform one mechanical condition (i.e. maximal strain and strain rate) per experimental trial. Currently, these conditions need to be manually adjusted throughout the duration of the experiment and all 6 chambers placed into the device undergo the same conditions. Automation will allow researchers to obtain more consistent results and stimulate a more physiological-like load without the need to come in at non-working hours.  

This project aims to analyze current designs of cell incubators and stretching devices to identify opportunities to combine both technologies into a single device. The device should help streamline the research process and improve researchers' ease of usability. Specifically, 6 individual chambers should be able to exhibit different strains and strain rates simultaneously. The device should be able to control and vary these conditions with time and shut off automatically without manual intervention. Ideally, this device should be biocompatible and have the capability to manually interchange separate stretching and compression (future project) components placed in a sterile housing capable of mimicking conditions present in a typical cell incubator. In addition, a benchtop climate-controlled (ie. carbon dioxide, nitrogen, humidity, and temperature composition) outer casing will be designed and prototyped to house the new stretching device. The expected final deliverable is a functional device that will be used in Dr. Wuertz's Tissue Regeneration and Mechanobiology and potentially other academic research labs. The resulting design and prototype must be biocompatible for multiple cell types and user-friendly to have a competitive advantage in academic research.
